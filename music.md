This page contains some music produced by my hidden Markov model based algorithmic music composition program.


# Hello Hello Little World

I have titled the first song produced by my program "Hello Hello Little World", as it was created by a model trained on "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", and "Hello World" is the name of the first program most programmers write.
