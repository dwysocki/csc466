1. Learning:
    *the activity or process of gaining knowledge or skill by studying,
     practicing, being taught, or experiencing something*
     ([Merriam-Webster Dictionary](
        http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/learning))

2. Machine Learning:
    *Machine Learning is the field of scientific study that concentrates on
     induction algorithms and on other algorithms that can be said to "learn".*
     ([Ron Kohavi, Stanford](
        http://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/glossary.html))

3. Machine learning was utilized to classify two subtypes of classical Cepheid
  variable stars: fundamental mode and first overtone. Stars in nearby galaxies
  are classified manually, and used as the training set. Both subtypes obey
  separate period-luminosity relations (an approximately linear relation),
  where fundamental mode Cepheids are brighter than first overtone (see red and
  blue points in figure below). When using the training data on a target
  galaxy, the difference in distance causes a shift in *all* brightnesses,
  and thus the target is shifted until it is "well aligned" with the training
  data according to two likelihood functions.
