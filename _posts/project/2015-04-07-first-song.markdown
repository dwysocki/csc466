The very first song has been generated by my program. I could go generate many more right now, but I wanted to take this moment to reflect on what I've accomplished.

The current implementation is not quite ideal, as some manual intervention is necessary before actual audio is played. It is also limited to the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, and rest (denoted z). In looking for a way to play my output, I discovered [ABC notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_notation), which I intend to use as input in the future. For now, I am translating the output by hand into ABC notation, which is fairly straightforward.

I trained a model with 3 states on the beginning of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, which I encoded as

    C
    C
    G
    G
    A
    A
    G
    z
    F
    F
    E
    E
    D
    D
    C
    z
    EOF


Here is what it sounds like played in key C

After training my model on this, I had it generate a sample, which terminated as soon as `EOF` was played (denotes the end of the file or song). The result was the very first song produced by my program.

Converted into ABC notation, this is

Here is the sheet music, which was generated with the help of <http://www.concertina.net/tunes_convert.html> after adding some annotations to the ABC file.
