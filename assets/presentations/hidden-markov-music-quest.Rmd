# Algorithmic Composition

## Knowledge-based Systems

- follow a set of rules defined by the programmer
- depends on knowledge of the programmer

## Machine Learning

- existing compositions are used to create a model
- new compositions are produced based on the model
    - deterministic
    - probabilistic
- challenging to find a model which captures the essence of music


# Markov Processes

## Definition

- the future depends only on the present
- nondeterministic
- may not perfectly represent the system being modeled
    - often serves as a good approximation

## Markov Chain

## Training a Markov Chain

- to train a Markov chain, simply count the occurences of each transition
- divide each element by its row's total

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{r||c|c|c}
& G & Y & R
\\\hline\hline
G & 45 & 5 & 0
\\\hline
Y & 0 & 25 & 25
\\\hline
R & 30 & 0 & 20
\end{tabular}
$\Rightarrow$
\begin{tabular}{r||c|c|c}
& G & Y & R
\\\hline\hline
G & 0.9 & 0.1 & 0
\\\hline
Y & 0 & 0.5 & 0.5
\\\hline
R & 0.6 & 0 & 0.4
\end{tabular}

## Hidden Markov Model

- Marvin the Martian is looking down at a traffic light from space
- he cannot see the actual lights, but instead he sees the speed and direction
  of the cars
- he can still model the traffic light, using an HMM

# Hidden Markov Music

## Overview

- we model songs as Markov processes
- notes are observed
- some underlying states of the song are hidden from us
    - we choose the number of states, and everything else is automatic
- we train the model on a song
    - allows us to generate new songs (algorithmic composition)


## Model

\begin{figure}

## First Song

- trained a model on Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

\movie{Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star}{audio/twinkle.mp3}

- produced the following song

\movie{First Song}{audio/first-song.mp3}



## Audio Samples

- *play a few audio samples here*

## Composer Models

- want to train models on composers, not just individual songs
- training algorithm only works on a single song at a time
- can join the songs together, but loses information


## Acknowlegements

Special thanks to Craig Graci, and Andrey Markov
