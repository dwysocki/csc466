# Algorithmic Composition

## Knowledge-based Systems

- follow a set of rules defined by the programmer
- depends on knowledge of the programmer

## Machine Learning

- existing compositions are used to create a model
- new compositions are produced based on the model
    - deterministic
    - probabilistic
- challenging to find a model which captures the essence of music



# Markov Processes

## Definition

- the future depends only on the present
- nondeterministic
- may not perfectly represent the system being modeled
    - often serves as a good approximation


## Markov Chain

## Training a Markov Chain

- to train a Markov chain, simply count the occurences of each transition
- divide each element by its row's total

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{r||c|c|c}
& G & Y & R
\\\hline\hline
G & 45 & 5 & 0
\\\hline
Y & 0 & 25 & 25
\\\hline
R & 30 & 0 & 20
\end{tabular}
$\Rightarrow$
\begin{tabular}{r||c|c|c}
& G & Y & R
\\\hline\hline
G & 0.9 & 0.1 & 0
\\\hline
Y & 0 & 0.5 & 0.5
\\\hline
R & 0.6 & 0 & 0.4
\end{tabular}

## Hidden Markov Model

- Marvin the Martian is looking down at a traffic light from space
- he cannot see the actual lights, but instead he sees the speed and direction
  of the cars
- he can still model the traffic light, using an HMM


## Hidden Markov Model Example

# Hidden Markov Music

## Overview

- we model songs as Markov processes
- notes are observed
- some underlying states of the song are hidden from us
    - we choose the number of states, and everything else is automatic
- we train the model on a song
    - allows us to generate new songs (algorithmic composition)


## Model

\begin{figure}

## Hello Hello Little World

- trained a model on Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star
  \playsong{twinkle.mp3}

- produced the following song
  \playsong{first-song.mp3}


## Für Elise (melody only)

- trained a model on Beethoven's Für Elise \playsong{elise.mp3}

- using 5 states \playsong{elise5.mp3}

- using 15 states \playsong{elise15.mp3}


## Für Elise (melody and duration)

- 50 states \playsong{elise_50_duration.mp3}
- 100 states \playsong{elise_100_duration.mp3}


## Korobeiniki (the Tetris song)

\playsong{tetris.mp3}

- 50 states \playsong{tetris_50.mp3}
- 100 states \playsong{tetris_100.mp3}



# Model Analysis

## State Probability Distributions

- any given state may *possibly* transition to any other state, and emit any
  note
- in practice, only a few are probable
- classify states according the number of probable transitions and emissions
    - classify songs according to their states


## Types of States

- transition type
    - linear progression
    - branch
- emission type
    - single note
    - multi note


## Transition Types

$$t = \textrm{\# probable transitions}$$

\begin{figure}
\transitiontypes
\end{figure}


## Emission Types

$$e = \textrm{\# probable emissions}$$

\begin{figure}
\emissiontypes
\end{figure}


## Song Signatures

\begin{gather*}
\vb{e} = \left\langle e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots \right\rangle,
\quad\quad\quad
\vb{t} = \left\langle t_1, t_2, t_3, \ldots \right\rangle
\\\\
e_i = \frac{\textrm{\# states with } e = i}{\textrm{total \# states}},
\quad\quad
t_i = \frac{\textrm{\# states with } t = i}{\textrm{total \# states}}
\\\\
\mathcal{S} = (\vb{e}, \vb{t})
\end{gather*}


## Song Comparison

- create a model for each song
    - use some criterion for determining # states
        - Akaike information criterion (AIC)
        - Bayesian information criterion (BIC)
- measure the angles between the vectors in their signature $\mathcal{S}$
    - cosine distance
